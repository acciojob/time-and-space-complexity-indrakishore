    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a way to represent the efficiency of an algorithm. It helps us understand how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Efficient algorithms are crucial for handling large datasets and ensuring scalability.</p>

    <p>Space complexity is another important aspect, measuring the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. For example, if an algorithm uses an additional array of size n, its space complexity is <b>O(n)</b>.</p>
