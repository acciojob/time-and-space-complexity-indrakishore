    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for designing efficient algorithms that perform well under various conditions.</p>

    <p>Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute. For example, an algorithm that uses an additional array of size n has a space complexity of <b>O(n)</b>. Considering space complexity is essential to ensure optimal memory usage, especially for large datasets.</p>
